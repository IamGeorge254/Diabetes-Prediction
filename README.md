# DIABETES PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
## Problem Statement

Diabetes is a rapidly growing global health concern, with millions of new cases diagnosed annually. Early detection is critical in preventing complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, and vision loss. Traditional diagnostic methods are often time-consuming, costly, and not always accessible. This project aims to address these challenges by leveraging machine learning techniques for early and accurate diabetes prediction.
## Proposed Solution

We propose a machine learning-based solution that analyzes medical data to predict diabetes risk. The system can efficiently handle large datasets, uncover hidden patterns, and deliver real-time results. Our solution is cost-effective, scalable, and helps healthcare providers make timely decisions, especially in low-resource settings.
## Data Processing Overview

We used a publicly available diabetes dataset containing medical information like glucose levels, BMI, age, and HbA1c_level. The data preprocessing steps included handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing continuous features. Feature selection was carried out to retain the most relevant predictors, ensuring optimal model performance.
## Analytics Insights - Visualizations

Exploratory data analysis revealed significant correlations between glucose level, BMI, and diabetes outcome. A correlation heatmap helped identify redundant features. Histograms showed that higher glucose and BMI values were associated with a greater likelihood of diabetes.
## Data Processing Overview

Outlier Detection and Removal: Applied Z-score analysis to detect outliers (threshold: |Z| > 3) and removed them to improve model reliability.


Data Normalization: Performed Min-Max Scaling to standardize numerical features between 0 and 1, ensuring fair model treatment across all inputs.


Class Imbalance Handling: Used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance the dataset, addressing the underrepresentation of diabetic cases.


Feature Selection: Retained only the most impactful variables based on correlation and feature importance analysis to enhance model performance.
