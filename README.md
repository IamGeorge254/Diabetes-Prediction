# DIABETES PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
## Problem Statement

Diabetes is a rapidly growing global health concern, with millions of new cases diagnosed annually. Early detection is critical in preventing complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, and vision loss. Traditional diagnostic methods are often time-consuming, costly, and not always accessible. This project aims to address these challenges by leveraging machine learning techniques for early and accurate diabetes prediction.
## Proposed Solution

We propose a machine learning-based solution that analyzes medical data to predict diabetes risk. The system can efficiently handle large datasets, uncover hidden patterns, and deliver real-time results. Our solution is cost-effective, scalable, and helps healthcare providers make timely decisions, especially in low-resource settings.
